The Mailchimp Content Style Guide goes into depth on many subjects. It may be more information than you need. Here are the most important things to know.

Principles
Good content is:

Clear
Useful
Friendly,Appropriate
Voice and tone
Mailchimp’s voice is:
Familiar
Friendly
Straightforward
Our tone changes depending on the situation, but it's generally informal. We have a sense of humor, but we value clarity over entertainment.

Our priorities are to educate our users about our products without patronizing or confusing them, so they can get their work done and get on with their lives.

Writing about people
We write and build apps with a person-first perspective. Being aware of the impact of your language will help make Mailchimp a better place to work and a better steward of our values in the world.

Don’t reference age or disability unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing.
Avoid gendered language and use the singular “they.”
When writing about a person, use their preferred pronouns; if you don’t know those, just use their name.

Grammar and mechanics
Some people will read every word you write. Others will just scan. Help everyone by grouping related ideas together and using descriptive headers and subheaders.
Focus your message, and create a hierarchy of information. Lead with the main point or the most important content.
Use active voice and positive language.
Use short words and sentences.
Avoid unnecessary modifiers.
Use specific examples.
Avoid vague language.
Be consistent. Adhere to the copy patterns and style points outlined in this guide.
Feel free to use contractions.
Use the serial comma. Otherwise, use common sense.
Don’t use underline, and don’t use any combination of italic, bold, caps, and underline.
When in doubt, read your writing out loud.
Web elements
Organize your page around one topic.
Use clear, descriptive terms that relate to the topic in titles and headings.
Give every image descriptive alt text.
Buttons should always contain actions. The language should be clear and concise. Capitalize every word, including articles.
Use sentence case for checkboxes and radio buttons.
Use title case for drop-down menu names and sentence case for menu items.
Use title case for form titles and sentence case for form fields. Only request information that we need and intend to use. Don’t ask for irrelevant personal information, like gender.
Use title case for main navigation. Use sentence case for subnavigation.
Use title case for headings and sentence case for subheadings.
Organize headings and subheadings in a hierarchy, with heading first, followed by subheadings in order.
Include the most relevant keywords in your headings and subheadings.
Provide a link whenever you’re referring to a website, relevant content, and trusted external resources.
Don’t say things like “Click here!” or “Click for more information” or “Read this.” Instead, link relevant keywords.
Use lists to present steps, groups, or sets of info. Set up your list with a brief introduction. Number lists when the order of information is important.
Writing for accessibility
Create a hierarchy, with the most important information first.
Place similar topics in the same paragraph, and clearly separate different topics with headings.
Use plain language. Write short sentences and familiar words.
Links should provide information on the associated action or destination. Avoid saying “click here” or “learn more.”
Avoid using images when descriptive text will do.
Avoid directional instructions or language that requires the reader to see the layout or design of the page.
Label inputs on forms with clear names and use appropriate tags. Think carefully about what fields are necessary, and especially which ones you mark as required.
Writing for translation
Use active voice.
Avoid double negatives.
Use contractions with caution.
Avoid using synonyms for the same word in a single piece of writing.
Write briefly, but don’t sacrifice clarity for brevity. You may need to repeat or add words to make the meaning of your sentences clear to a translator.
Avoid slang, idioms, and cliches.
Avoid unnecessary abbreviations.

Was my import successful?
After you import contacts, we recommend you check out the results on your Import History page. The Import History page includes details on any errors we found, and tells you which email addresses to review for issues to troubleshoot. These details remain on the Import History page for 24 hours.

To learn more about your import results and how to find them, check out View Your Contact Import Results.

In this article, you'll learn how to use our import tool to add and update contacts in Mailchimp.

Before you start
Here are some things to know before you begin this process.

Free plans include up to 500 contacts and 1,000 sends per month, with a daily send limit of 500. To learn more, check out our pricing page. To change your plan type, visit the plans page in your account.
To get started with a file import, you'll need a blank sheet in a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, saved or exported as a comma separated value (CSV) file.
Certain fields, like birthday and date, must be formatted in a specific way. Make sure you're familiar with our format guidelines before importing your file.
In Mailchimp, you can categorize your contacts based on their email marketing status, such as subscribed or unsubscribed. You can only import to one status at a time.
If you’d like to send postcards to your contacts, check out our article on how to import mailing addresses.
If your import brings your total contact count above the limit of your Marketing plan tier, you'll be subject to an additional contact charge.

Import new contacts from a file
The file import process has two parts: First, you'll prepare your spreadsheet of contacts outside of Mailchimp and save it as a CSV file. Next, you'll use our import tool to upload your file and add your contacts to your Mailchimp audience.

Prepare for import
To prepare your file for import, follow these steps.

In a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, open your blank worksheet.
Create and label a column for Email Address. This is the only field we require.

Next to your Email Address column, create and label additional columns for First Name, Last Name, and any other information you want to import to Mailchimp.

To learn how to format phone numbers, birthdays, mailing addresses, and other types of data, check out Format Guidelines for Your Import File.

Paste your contacts' information into the relevant fields in the spreadsheet.

Save the file in CSV format. This option can usually be accessed from the File menu in your spreadsheet program, labeled as "Export as .CSV" or "Download as .CSV". Different spreadsheet programs may vary.
Nice job! Now that you've prepared your CSV file, you're ready to import.

Note

Cursor Clicks - Groups - File Upload
You'll only see this option if you have groups in your audience.
If you want to update contacts that are already in your audience, check the box next to Update any existing contacts.

Note

Imported subscribers don't go through the signup process, so you'll need to verify that you have permission to email them.
When you import contacts to an existing audience, we won’t include any duplicate, bounced, or unsubscribed addresses that are already stored in the audience.
Because all audiences in Mailchimp are independent of each other, we can't detect duplicates, bounces, or unsubscribes across multiple audiences. If you have duplicate contacts in different audiences, you may find it helpful to combine your audiences into a primary audience that uses groups or tags.
Update existing contacts
You may need to update your contacts’ data if they’ve been in your audience for a while. Use our import tool to quickly update multiple contacts at once.

This option replaces existing audience field information with new information from your import file. You’ll follow the same process to import new contacts, but there are a few extra things to consider.

When you prepare your spreadsheet, verify that the column names in your import file match the fields in your Mailchimp audience, and that no columns are left blank. Blank fields overwrite and erase existing contact data.
You can only update subscribed or non-subscribed contacts with this method.
Imports won’t update the email marketing status of contacts already in your Mailchimp account.
Proceed with a file import, and follow the steps to upload your file and match your columns. On the Organize step of the import, check the box next to Update any existing contacts.

Cursor Clicks - Update any existing contacts - File Upload

That's it! When you import, we'll handle the rest by scanning your contacts and updating their information.
